# What is a Trusted Research Environment?


Trusted Research Environment are the computing equivalent of a reference library.   

Accredited individuals are able to obtain access to information within the system and then undertake analysis or review the data whilst within the system.  The core data never leaves the system and what is taken away may be restricted or reviewed.

This approach is particularly appealing with healthcare data as it provides a way to make data available in a secure way, whilst maximising access for research to make advancements for patients and the wider public.
  

## Safeguards

TREs are underpinned by 5 principles:

- Safe People

Users of the system must be accredited, undetake training and agree to utilise the data and systems in appropriate ways.

- Safe Projects

Data is only used for projects with sounds ethics, which have a clear research plan with public benefit.

- Safe Settings

Access is only possible by using secure technology and data never leaves the TRE.

- Safe Data

Privacy is ensure by making data available in a de-identified manner.

- Safe Outputs

Only certain data can leave the TRE, and checks are made to ensure that it remains de-identified.
