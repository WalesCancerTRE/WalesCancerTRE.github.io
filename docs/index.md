# Wales Cancer TRE Project

Establishing the Trusted Research Environment for Cancer Researchers in Wales.

The Wales Cancer TRE is based on the concept of consolidating existing activity into a shared and federated infrastructure allowing activity and research which has historically proved more challenging using task specific data release models where agrements, processes, permissions and data are prepared in diffrent ways for each project.

The TRE will interlink key data assets, high-performance analysis platforms, along with agreed processes to access the data and predefined processes for data release.

## Pillars of our TRE
